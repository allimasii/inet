INET Framework for OMNEST/OMNeT++
=================================

The INET framework is an open-source communication networks simulation
package, written for the OMNEST/OMNeT++ simulation system. The INET framework
contains models for several Internet protocols: beyond TCP and IP there is UDP,
Ethernet, PPP and MPLS with LDP and RSVP-TE signalling. See the CREDITS file
for the names of people who have contributed to the INET Framework.

Example simulations are grouped into the following subdirectories:

   Ethernet/           example Ethernet networks
   INET/               TCP/IP-based example networks
   IPv6/               IPv6-based example networks
   SCTP/               SCTP examples
   RTP/                RTP examples (not yet integrated)
   ExternalInterface/  examples using external interface to connect with real networks
   Adhoc/              mobile and ad-hoc networks (incomplete)
   Wireless/           IEEE 802.11 examples
   MPLS/               example networks for MPLS/LDP/RSVP-TE
   OSPFv2/             OSPF examples

The package's main README file contains links to additional info to help you
get started with the framework.
