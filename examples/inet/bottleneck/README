In this example the network consists of one client, one router and one server.
IP addresses and routing tables are set up by using mrt files.

The router is the bottleneck in this scenario, because of its limited queue
frame capacity and the asymmetric channel settings.

The client sends 100 MB of data to the server using TCP.

Connections uplink and downlink throughput is measured by throughput meters.

Different configurations demonstrate the impact of TCP's optional selective
acknowledgment (SACK) option on connections throughput.
